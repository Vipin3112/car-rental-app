This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What i've implemented ?
1. There will be a Landing page which ask for Location and Start Date.
2. Once provided the app will animate to the next page.
3. The next page will contain a list of cards for CARS.
4. You can select a CAR by clicking on the select button.
5. All the cars are sorted according to the availability.
6. You can search for cars in the search box provided above.
7. There is a button in the lower left corner with a Tornabo Symbol on it. Click on it to bring up more filer options.


## How to get this thing working ?
1. Use `git clone` or download the zip.
2. If you've downloaded the zip extract it.
3. `cd` into the repository.
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn` (if you're using it)
5. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` (Again if you're using it)
6. A browser window will automatically open & in case if it didn't open your favourite browser and go to : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## What did I use to build it ?
1. **React.js** my choice of front end framework for almost all projects.
2. **node-uuid** to generate cars id which were not provided by the API.
3. **SASS** Syntactically Awesome.
4. Where is **REDUX** ? you might be asking but to be honest I didn't felt the need of using **REDUX** in this project.
